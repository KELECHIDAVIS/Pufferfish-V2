todo: 
-perft:
	depth of 4 has more captures than supposed to (1610 spose to be 1576)
	- main issues brought up, should only be counting moves flags when at a depth of 1 
	- should be counting checks deliverd by making the move ( in the loop)
	- *implement a zobrist hash so I can sanity check that my board state is exactly the same after a make move and unmake move cycle. 
	- make a testing cli similar to stockfish that allows me to set board position, make moves, and divide at certain depths
