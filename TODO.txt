-perft:
	-there is a bug with en passant capture:
		- review the move code very carefully and figure out why it's it giving a different output.
		Move diffs  
		- a2a4(-27 ) b7b5 (-27) a4b5 (-27) (CAPTURED PAWN TURN
		S INTO X (INVALID!)) 
			- now all moves give slightly different movecount then stockfish so will pick the top one 
			a7a5 (FEN printing should show ep able to be taken after this move ) ( also, white can't take pawn after black double pawn push so there is a bug with the double pawn push ep setting or ep move generation)

			missing moves b5a6 (ep capture ) and b5b6 (single pawn push)  
			my guess is because it turns into and "X" instead of being a pawn so it can't do any pawn moves
