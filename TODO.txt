things to add later :
Additional Improvements to Consider
1. Three-fold Repetition Detection
You'll need to add position hashing (Zobrist hashing) to detect repeated positions:
c// Pseudo-code
if (positionRepeatedThreeTimes(board)) {
    return DRAW_SCORE;
}


1.5 : through zobrist hashing, add transposition tables to memoize calculated board positions we've already seen when searching moves
1.6: will continue transposition tables 

2. Insufficient Material
Detect positions where neither side can mate (e.g., K vs K, K+B vs K):
cif (hasInsufficientMaterial(board)) {
    return DRAW_SCORE;
}
3. Better Mate Distance Handling
When you get a mate score from a child node, you might want to verify it's actually a mate:
c// Check if score is a mate score
#define IS_MATE_SCORE(score) (abs(score) > MATE_SCORE - 1000)
