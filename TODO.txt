-perft: 
	to make the make and umake move functions simpler i am going to redo them from scratch to make sure that everything is taken care of cleanly.
	** if still having trouble after this, check out movegeneration, might be generating illegal moves 
	** also make sure the board initialization is working properly, print out all the piece bitboard and mailbox to make sure everyting is gucci. 
	** also 

**for some reason, the moves that are being generated in a depth of 2 is the pawn attacks? 

Board unmake may have a bug in it that doesn't reset the board fully, caliing go perft 1 twice in a row results in different answers ** bad 
Since this is occuring at very low depth this prolly is because unmakeMove isn't setting back state properly:
